MCTextureSplinter

A tool for splitting the pieces of Minecraft texture pack files (terrain.png and
items.png) into individual pngs that can be edited and recombined.

Since the texture pack structure was changed in 1.5, this utility has become
obsolete and development has stopped.

Requires:
  Python 2.7 (Possibly others)

Python Modules:
  PIL (Python Imaging Library)
  Tkinter
